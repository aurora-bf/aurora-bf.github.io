I'm a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Scripps Institution of Oceanography working with [Ian Eisenman](https://eisenman.ucsd.edu/). I received my PhD in September 2024 from the [Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) within NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, advised by [Laure Zanna](https://zanna-researchteam.github.io/).

I am interested in large-scale climate and ocean dynamics, especially building understanding using theoretical tools and model hierarchies. I have worked on a range of topics including understanding the ocean response to Antarctic meltwater input, estimation of changes in the hydrological cycle from trends in ocean tracers, and radiative responses to local surface temperature changes. 
\
\
Recently, I am working on an idealized model of surface temperature variability which offers physical insight into the factors leading to monthly-to-interannual variability change under anthropogenic forcing. I've also been interested in using machine learning to add to (or "correct" from) traditional linear methods of emulation (linear response theory/Green's functions) with a goal of emulating surface temperature change and variability under a range of emissions scenarios.
